.tx-x-large[Desktop-First / Beta Release Notes]

## I had originally intended to design this report in some clever way that was mobile-first and responsive ... but I got lost in all the code along the way. Weekend hacking projects will do that to you (wink). If you're visiting by mobile -- which is super likely -- please turn around. Next week I'll release a mobile-only version for fun. I'm learning! —JM

.quote-medium[.fg-white.tx-sans[Welcome to a new format for the Design in Tech Report. For this year's report, I took a stab at learning all the CSS/JS that I've always wanted to know, and then went after the task of making a fully responsive report. I've partially succeeded on my road there with this letterbox-only version — which is better than a PDF, but it's a little buggy. Sorry!
 <br /><br />When you see <span style="background: #6918F9;color: white; padding: 2px 2px;">Refresh Screen If Needed</span> please refresh your window and a dynamic diagram is likely to reappear.

# Key takeaways from the Design In Tech Reports

.grid-3-across[
.box-no-indent[
.subhead-box.bg-em[2015]

* 14 creative firms were atypically acquired between 2004 and 2015 by tech companies like Facebook, Flextronics, Google; also Accenture, Capital One, BBVA, McKinsey & Co.
* As the marginal return on computing power (a la Moore’s law) diminishes and technology is less of a differentiating factor, the value of design has entered the foreground.
* 27 startups that were co-founded by designers were acquired since 2010 by companies like Intuit, Google, Facebook, Adobe, LinkedIn, and Yahoo.
* Five (20%) of the top cumulative-funded VC-backed ventures that have raised additional capital since 2013 are noted to have designer co-founders.
* There were no designers on Silicon Valley's fabled “Sand Hill Road” until January of 2014 when Kleiner Perkins appointed their first Design Partner **John Maeda**. Shortly afterwards six more VC firms acquired new Design Partners.
* .fg-em-z.tx-sans[ <i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> **DESIGN <i class="fal fa-arrow-right"></i> DE$IGN** Designing for mobile brought new experience constraints compared with the desktop, and made designers' skills invaluable as the pathway to non-techy consumers.]
]
.box-no-indent[
.subhead-box.bg-em[2016]
.comment[* Design isn’t just about beauty; it’s about market relevance and meaningful results. Gartner reports that 89% of companies believe that customer experience will be their primary basis for competition versus 36% five years prior.)
]
* Design firm acquisitions continue: 42 design firms since 2004, and ~50% of them in the last year alone. Accenture, Deloitte, IBM take the lead.
* Designers in venture capital have increased: More designers entered VC in the last two years than the previous 4 years combined. Its history is revealed.
* 93.5% of 370 designers surveyed believe that coding and data-oriented skills are table stakes knowledge for designers in tech.
.comment[* 86% of design students surveyed say that they learned their digital skills from resources outside their coursework. Design education lags the technology industry’s needs for data-oriented, coding-enabled graduates with business acumen.)
]
* 100% of the top 10 business schools have student-led design/innovation clubs. 6-7% of the 2015 class of HBS take product management jobs.
* Designing Systems and Designer Culture emerge as key methods for design to achieve scale — building on agency practices and Karl Gerstner's pioneering work on Designing Programmes.
* Instead of seeing diversity as a problem that needs solving, designing for inclusion becomes an economic opportunity and cultural responsibility.
* .fg-em-z.tx-sans[ <i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> **The 3 Kinds of Design** There are 3 kinds of design: Classical Design, Design Thinking, and Computational Design. The most business value is being driven by the latter two kinds of design.]
]
.box-no-indent[
.subhead-box.bg-em[2017]
* Demand for designers is up with Facebook, Google, and Amazon collectively growing designer headcount by 65% in a year according to LinkedIn.
* McKinsey & Co and Salesforce make significant bets on design with more acquisitions. Design tool startup InVision acquires 5 smaller startups.
.comment[* 4 Design Partners are elected at McKinsey & Co and IBM appoints 3 Distinguished Designers — to the highest senior levels of a corporate hierarchy.
]
* Design tools begin to evolve out of print and early web design paradigms from the Photoshop era to encompass prototyping, project management, version control, inline coding, and automation.
* Voice- and chat-based interfaces are grounded in mental models that don't require a visual representation. Related and unrelated artificial intelligence advancements are accelerating.
* Coverage of tech design trends in China begins. Chinese design in tech principles and practices are leading the world, and are often overlooked.
* 90% of designers surveyed say that having a more diverse design team is personally important to them. The number one request inside their companies is to: "Talk about it more internally."
* .fg-em-z.tx-sans[<i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> **Inclusive Design Takes Off** Adopting an inclusive design approach expands a tech product’s total addressable market. The tipping point for inclusive design begins to tip.]

# Classical Designers Tend to Look Down on Design Thinking

.quote-big.fg-dkgray[The reduction of a complex creative problem-solving mindset into five steps makes design seem easy when it’s not. A certificate for the completion of a design thinking course is not enough to transform a business into the next Apple. So don’t be deceived by the demystification of the design process or the chance to workshop out million-dollar ideas over post-its. There’s more to design than what design thinking dealers are preaching.

.quote-small[[Bon Ku](https://twitter.com/BonKu/), MD, MPP /

In my experience, Design Thinking provides a platform for non-designers (myself included) - doctors, nurses and medical students - to work with designers.
DT is a primer that provides us a shared language. Many of us who are in health care have already been practicing elements of DT (empathizing, prototyping, testing, etc.) but we just didn't know what to call it.

I do not believe that DT is a step by step recipe. We teach our medical students to develop a design mindset and build their creative muscles. Design thinking helps us to reimagine a better future state of health care and give us some more tools in how to get there. <br /><br />

# You're not getting any younger. You're getting B(older).

.quote-big.fg-dkgray[Restricting its estimate to those aged 60 and up, market research firm Euromonitor predicts that by 2020, worldwide older-adult spending will reach $15 trillion—and that's still well before global aging will fully hit its stride. By 2030, the Boston Consulting Group estimates that the 55-plus population will have been responsible for 50 percent of the US consumer spending growth since 2008, 67 percent of that of Japan, and 86 percent for that of Germany. It's no exaggeration to say that the world's most advanced economies will soon revolve around the needs, wants, and whims of grandparents.

* Design is generally used early in the product development process instead of applied at the very end before it is shipped.
* Creating an inclusive culture for designers is how to start building better products. Listening to what they value is how to start.
* Unconscious bias is promoted by stereotypes that exclude others. Recognizing exclusion is a way to take immediate action.
* Design tools and systems are ch-ch-changing these days. Among many new capabilities, machine intelligence looks to change everything.
* We're in a golden age of data visualization and quant-qual science. The tools that are available today enable understanding -- for those who want it.
* User research skills and product management skills are vital for designers to understand to work more inclusively with customers and product colleagues.

# Whatever you do, don't F up the culture

.quote-big.fg-dkgray[Why is culture so important to a business? Here is a simple way to frame it. The stronger the culture, the less corporate process a company needs. When the culture is strong, you can trust everyone to do the right thing. People can be independent and autonomous. They can be entrepreneurial. And if we have a company that is entrepreneurial in spirit, we will be able to take our next "(wo)man on the moon" leap. In organizations (or even in a society) where culture is weak, you need an abundance of heavy, precise rules and processes.

# Mobile phones have more sensors than a microphone these days

.grid-3-across[
.box[
In 2018, currently [Android Docs](https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensor-types) lists Android Sensor Types as having 9 base sensors. And there are 5 other "composite sensor" types that are created out of the base sensor systems. Two sensors not listed there are the microphone and visible light camera — of which smartphones today now sport two each, at least.<br /><br />For context, a BMW 5-series car has a 100 or more sensors.

* 88% of designers surveyed believe that it will be at least 5 years or more until visual designers are replaced by AI. AI can already do a lot right now.
* The history of AI and generating visual art goes back to the 1960s with A. Michael Noll and other artists at Bell Labs, and stretches back to Marcel Duchamp.
* AI is extremely proficient at tedious tasks that no human should really have to do, like: adjust image contrast, correct messy lines, and re-style images.
* Google is by far the leader in mixing AI with design experimentation due to the amazing talent they've acquired like Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas — who at IBM first advanced data visualization with their landmark <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bewitched.com/manyeyes.html">Many Eyes</a>.
* AI is showing us the unintended consequences of running what appear to be "fair" algorithms that feed off of past activity and practices that are converted into training data. But embedded in that training data is our long history of exclusion.

.subhead-slim.bg-em[We can expect AI to only widen the digital divide]
* It's easy in the technology world to look away from inequality becaus the privileges that come with tech life are pleasurable and self-fulfilling.
* But designers in tech can easily forget that they're in a tiny minority of the population that doesn't really match their much broader consumer market.
* So getting out of the tech bubble can be a simple yet powerful way to better connect with "real" people who don't really need what is being created today. Ultimately, it becomes a way to design and make better products for all people.
* A majority of designers in tech find themselves not working solely on premise. This means that we are entering an era where work can be more evenly distributed outside of hubs like Silicon Valley.
* Our design imperative at Automattic is to imagine a world where WordPress is good design for all. And we're currently exploring how remote work can achieve a new level of inclusive design.

.fg-dkgray[While urban poverty is a unique challenge, rates of poverty have historically been higher in rural than urban areas. In fact, levels of rural poverty were often double those in urban areas throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

1. Poverty is higher in rural areas
2. Most new jobs aren’t in rural areas

It’s easy to see why many rural Americans believe the recession never ended: For them, it hasn’t.<br /><br />

* Changing perception around the idea of "helping those who are less fortunate than ourselves" into "learning how ignorant we are as privileged people" is a useful daily exercise.
* Using that energy to design and make better products is a certain kind of passion and practice that we'll see more often in technology companies. Because inclusive design is becoming commonsense.
* Choose action over wondering about what you can do about the world you see and don't agree with. It's easy today due to all the technologies we have available to us.
