# Useful feedback on the 2017 #DesignInTech Report

## Positive Sentiments Shared

* "I've been calling myself a designer-developer—now changed, thanks 2017 #DesignInTech report."
* "I'm putting your oral #designintech preso on @SoundCloud on repeat."
* "Congrats @simplysecureorg for the #designintech shoutout. Great work in privacy & security."
* "Designers Who Code & Write: opportune time to digest the #DesignInTech report."
* "#DesignInTech 'reframes computational design as driver of accelerated growth.'"
* "'Design isn't just about beauty; it's about relevance and meaningful results.'"

## Constructive Criticism Shared
* "Adding useless adjectives in front of the word 'designer' isn't doing anything positive for the industry."
* "Using small gray text in the DesignInTech Report excludes anyone with visual difficulties."
* "Appalled in 2017 to see platitude of 'Design is not about beauty.'"
* "When computational design dominates, will we have a Universal Design Income?"

# Desktop-First / Beta Release Notes

.body[

I had originally intended to design this report in some clever way that was mobile-first and responsive ... but I got lost in all the code along the way. Weekend hacking projects will do that to you (wink). If you're visiting by mobile -- which is super likely -- please turn around. Next week I'll release a mobile-only version for fun. I'm learning! —JM

# Welcome

.body.text-sans[

Welcome to a new format for the Design in Tech Report. For this year's report, I took a stab at learning all the CSS/JS that I've always wanted to know, and then went after the task of making a fully responsive report. I've partially succeeded on my road there with this letterbox-only version — which is better than a PDF, but it's a little buggy. Sorry!

When you see .refresh[Refresh Screen If Needed] please refresh your window and a dynamic diagram is likely to reappear. Chrome seems to work best with this report. If you don't like an interactive version like this, please visit the one[**](https://www.slideshare.net/johnmaeda/design-in-tech-report-2018) on Slideshare.

Expect a video version on my new YouTube channel "John Maeda is Learning" by this weekend that walks you through all these findings.

# Key takeaways from the Design In Tech Reports

.timeline[

*	## 2015
	* > 14 creative firms were atypically acquired between 2004 and 2015 by tech companies like Facebook, Flextronics, Google; also Accenture, Capital One, BBVA, McKinsey & Co.
	* > As the marginal return on computing power (a la Moore’s law) diminishes and technology is less of a differentiating factor, the value of design has entered the foreground.
	* > 27 startups that were co-founded by designers were acquired since 2010 by companies like Intuit, Google, Facebook, Adobe, LinkedIn, and Yahoo.
	* > Five (20%) of the top cumulative-funded VC-backed ventures that have raised additional capital since 2013 are noted to have designer co-founders.
	* > There were no designers on Silicon Valley's fabled “Sand Hill Road” until January of 2014 when Kleiner Perkins appointed their first Design Partner **John Maeda**. Shortly afterwards six more VC firms acquired new Design Partners.
	* > _ .fas.fa-chart-line[] **DESIGN DE$IGN** Designing for mobile brought new experience constraints compared with the desktop, and made designers' skills invaluable as the pathway to non-techy consumers. _

* ## 2016
	* > Design firm acquisitions continue: 42 design firms since 2004, and ~50% of them in the last year alone. Accenture, Deloitte, IBM take the lead.
	* > Designers in venture capital have increased: More designers entered VC in the last two years than the previous 4 years combined. Its history is revealed.
	* > 93.5% of 370 designers surveyed believe that coding and data-oriented skills are table stakes knowledge for designers in tech.
	<!-- * 86% of design students surveyed say that they learned their digital skills from resources outside their coursework. Design education lags the technology industry’s needs for data-oriented, coding-enabled graduates with business acumen.) -->
	* > 100% of the top 10 business schools have student-led design/innovation clubs. 6-7% of the 2015 class of HBS take product management jobs.
	* > Designing Systems and Designer Culture emerge as key methods for design to achieve scale — building on agency practices and Karl Gerstner's pioneering work on Designing Programmes.
	* > Instead of seeing diversity as a problem that needs solving, designing for inclusion becomes an economic opportunity and cultural responsibility.
	* > _ .fas.fa-chart-line[] **The 3 Kinds of Design** There are 3 kinds of design: Classical Design, Design Thinking, and Computational Design. The most business value is being driven by the latter two kinds of design. _

* ## 2017
	* > Demand for designers is up with Facebook, Google, and Amazon collectively growing designer headcount by 65% in a year according to LinkedIn.
	* > McKinsey & Co and Salesforce make significant bets on design with more acquisitions. Design tool startup InVision acquires 5 smaller startups.
	<!-- * 4 Design Partners are elected at McKinsey & Co and IBM appoints 3 Distinguished Designers — to the highest senior levels of a corporate hierarchy. -->
	* > Design tools begin to evolve out of print and early web design paradigms from the Photoshop era to encompass prototyping, project management, version control, inline coding, and automation.
	* > Voice- and chat-based interfaces are grounded in mental models that don't require a visual representation. Related and unrelated artificial intelligence advancements are accelerating.
	* > Coverage of tech design trends in China begins. Chinese design in tech principles and practices are leading the world, and are often overlooked.
	* > 90% of designers surveyed say that having a more diverse design team is personally important to them. The number one request inside their companies is to: "Talk about it more internally."
	* > _ .fas.fa-chart-line[] **Inclusive Design Takes Off** Adopting an inclusive design approach expands a tech product’s total addressable market. The tipping point for inclusive design begins to tip. _

# Design in Tech Reports simplified

.timeline[

*	## 2015
	* _Design isn't just about beauty; it’s about market relevance and meaningful results._
	* DESIGN is about DE$IGN — and it's traditionally been that case since the era of the Bauhaus, and even way before.

* ## 2016
	* _There are 3 kinds of design: Classical Design, Design Thinking, and Computational Design._
	* There are 3 kinds of design: Classical Design, Design Thinking, and Computational Design.

* ## 2017
	* _Adopting an inclusive design approach expands a tech product’s total addressable market._
	* Inclusion is good business. And new proof points are emerging. More will start to emerge as inclusive design takes hold.
