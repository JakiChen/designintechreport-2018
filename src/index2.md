# Desktop-First / Beta Release Notes

.body[

I had originally intended to design this report in some clever way that was mobile-first and responsive ... but I got lost in all the code along the way. Weekend hacking projects will do that to you (wink). If you're visiting by mobile -- which is super likely -- please turn around. Next week I'll release a mobile-only version for fun. I'm learning! —JM

# Welcome

.body.text-sans[

Welcome to a new format for the Design in Tech Report. For this year's report, I took a stab at learning all the CSS/JS that I've always wanted to know, and then went after the task of making a fully responsive report. I've partially succeeded on my road there with this letterbox-only version — which is better than a PDF, but it's a little buggy. Sorry!

When you see .refresh[Refresh Screen If Needed] please refresh your window and a dynamic diagram is likely to reappear. Chrome seems to work best with this report. If you don't like an interactive version like this, please visit the one[**](https://www.slideshare.net/johnmaeda/design-in-tech-report-2018) on Slideshare.

Expect a video version on my new YouTube channel "John Maeda is Learning" by this weekend that walks you through all these findings.

# Key takeaways from the Design In Tech Reports

.stack[

*	### .large.mono[2015]
	> 14 creative firms were atypically acquired between 2004 and 2015 by tech companies like Facebook, Flextronics, Google; also Accenture, Capital One, BBVA, McKinsey & Co.

	<!-- -->

	> As the marginal return on computing power (a la Moore’s law) diminishes and technology is less of a differentiating factor, the value of design has entered the foreground.

	<!-- -->

	> 27 startups that were co-founded by designers were acquired since 2010 by companies like Intuit, Google, Facebook, Adobe, LinkedIn, and Yahoo.

	<!-- -->

	> Five (20%) of the top cumulative-funded VC-backed ventures that have raised additional capital since 2013 are noted to have designer co-founders.

	<!-- -->

	> There were no designers on Silicon Valley's fabled “Sand Hill Road” until January of 2014 when Kleiner Perkins appointed their first Design Partner **John Maeda**. Shortly afterwards six more VC firms acquired new Design Partners.

	<!-- -->

	> .purple.sans[.fas.fa-chart-line[] **DESIGN DE$IGN** Designing for mobile brought new experience constraints compared with the desktop, and made designers' skills invaluable as the pathway to non-techy consumers.]

* ### .large.mono[2016]
	> Design firm acquisitions continue: 42 design firms since 2004, and ~50% of them in the last year alone. Accenture, Deloitte, IBM take the lead.

	<!-- -->

	> Designers in venture capital have increased: More designers entered VC in the last two years than the previous 4 years combined. Its history is revealed.

	<!-- -->

	> 93.5% of 370 designers surveyed believe that coding and data-oriented skills are table stakes knowledge for designers in tech.

	<!-- > 86% of design students surveyed say that they learned their digital skills from resources outside their coursework. Design education lags the technology industry’s needs for data-oriented, coding-enabled graduates with business acumen.) -->

	> 100% of the top 10 business schools have student-led design/innovation clubs. 6-7% of the 2015 class of HBS take product management jobs.

	<!-- -->

	> Designing Systems and Designer Culture emerge as key methods for design to achieve scale — building on agency practices and Karl Gerstner's pioneering work on Designing Programmes.

	<!-- -->

	> Instead of seeing diversity as a problem that needs solving, designing for inclusion becomes an economic opportunity and cultural responsibility.

	<!-- -->

	> .purple.sans[.fas.fa-chart-line[] **The 3 Kinds of Design** There are 3 kinds of design: Classical Design, Design Thinking, and Computational Design. The most business value is being driven by the latter two kinds of design.]

* ### .large.mono[2017]
	> Demand for designers is up with Facebook, Google, and Amazon collectively growing designer headcount by 65% in a year according to LinkedIn.

	<!-- -->

	> McKinsey & Co and Salesforce make significant bets on design with more acquisitions. Design tool startup InVision acquires 5 smaller startups.

	<!-- > 4 Design Partners are elected at McKinsey & Co and IBM appoints 3 Distinguished Designers — to the highest senior levels of a corporate hierarchy. -->

	> Design tools begin to evolve out of print and early web design paradigms from the Photoshop era to encompass prototyping, project management, version control, inline coding, and automation.

	<!-- -->

	> Voice- and chat-based interfaces are grounded in mental models that don't require a visual representation. Related and unrelated artificial intelligence advancements are accelerating.

	<!-- -->

	> Coverage of tech design trends in China begins. Chinese design in tech principles and practices are leading the world, and are often overlooked.

	<!-- -->

	> 90% of designers surveyed say that having a more diverse design team is personally important to them. The number one request inside their companies is to: "Talk about it more internally."

	<!-- -->

	> .purple.sans[.fas.fa-chart-line[] **Inclusive Design Takes Off** Adopting an inclusive design approach expands a tech product’s total addressable market. The tipping point for inclusive design begins to tip.]

# You're not getting any younger. You're getting B(older).

.darkgray[Restricting its estimate to those aged 60 and up, market research firm Euromonitor predicts that by 2020, worldwide older-adult spending will reach $15 trillion—and that's still well before global aging will fully hit its stride. By 2030, the Boston Consulting Group estimates that the 55-plus population will have been responsible for 50 percent of the US consumer spending growth since 2008, 67 percent of that of Japan, and 86 percent for that of Germany. It's no exaggeration to say that the world's most advanced economies will soon revolve around the needs, wants, and whims of grandparents.]

## Design capabilities don't scale like Moore's Law

* Design is generally used early in the product development process instead of applied at the very end before it is shipped.
* Creating an inclusive culture for designers is how to start building better products. Listening to what they value is how to start.
* Unconscious bias is promoted by stereotypes that exclude others. Recognizing exclusion is a way to take immediate action.
* Design tools and systems are ch-ch-changing these days. Among many new capabilities, machine intelligence looks to change everything.
* We're in a golden age of data visualization and quant-qual science. The tools that are available today enable understanding -- for those who want it.
* User research skills and product management skills are vital for designers to understand to work more inclusively with customers and product colleagues.

# Whatever you do, don't F up the culture

> Why is culture so important to a business? Here is a simple way to frame it. The stronger the culture, the less corporate process a company needs. When the culture is strong, you can trust everyone to do the right thing. People can be independent and autonomous. They can be entrepreneurial. And if we have a company that is entrepreneurial in spirit, we will be able to take our next "(wo)man on the moon" leap. In organizations (or even in a society) where culture is weak, you need an abundance of heavy, precise rules and processes.
